{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

FreeSpeechMe (AKA Convergence for Namecoin) was previously used for Namecoin TLS and Tor support.  This functionality is now implemented by other projects.  See the following links for current replacements:

* [TLS]({{ "/docs/tls-client/" | relative_url }})
* [Tor]({{ "/docs/tor-resolution/" | relative_url }})
