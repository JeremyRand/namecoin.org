We've released Electrum-NMC v3.1.3-beta1.  This release supports Namecoin currency transactions, but does not yet support AuxPoW or name transactions.  This release is based on work by both ahmedbodi and myself.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{site.baseurl}}download/betas/#electrum-nmc).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund.
