We've released Electrum-NMC v3.3.6.1.  This release includes a fix for a PyInstaller build script issue that was introduced in v3.3.6, which unfortunately slipped by us until a few minutes after v3.3.6 was released.  The only binaries affected by that issue were the Windows-specific binaries; users of the v3.3.6 Python, GNU/Linux, and Android binaries are unaffected.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{ "/download/betas/#electrum-nmc" | relative_url }}).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund and Cyphrs.
