This release smooths the transition to a new Namecoin codebase rebased on the latest version of Bitcoin!

## Softfork

Starting at block height 212500 (around New Year’s Eve) miners will begin applying some checks for edge cases. There is a a small chance that miners running older versions will fork, so all pool operators and solo miners **must** update. Regular users should update too but the traditional precaution of waiting for six confirmations should be safe as well.

Be safe and **make an encrypted backup of your wallet.dat file before updating**. Thanks to everybody who helped make this happen!
