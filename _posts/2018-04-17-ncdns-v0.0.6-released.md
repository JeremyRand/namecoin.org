We've released ncdns v0.0.6.  List of changes:

* Windows installer:
    - Bump ConsensusJ-Namecoin dependency to v0.2.7.
    - Bump Dnssec-Trigger dependency to v0.15.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - Bump dnssec-keygen dependency to v9.12.1.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - Code quality improvements.  (Patch by Hugo Landau; reported by Jeremy Rand.)
* NetBSD:
    - Disable NetBSD/ARM builds due to an upstream bug.  NetBSD/ARM builds will return later.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
* All OS's:
    - certinject: Add support for NSS trust stores; this enables positive TLS overrides in Chromium on GNU/Linux (and probably various other software that uses NSS for certificate validation.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - ncdumpzone: Add `cert_override.txt` output format; this enables positive TLS overrides in Firefox (and probably various other software based on Firefox).  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - Fix TLSA records served over DNS (for the lucky users using software that supports DANE).  (Patch by Jeremy Rand; reported by Jefferson Carpenter.)
    - Bundle miekg's `q`.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - Bundle `dns-prop279`.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - Change default Namecoin RPC host from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1`; should fix some RPC errors on Windows.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
    - Code quality improvements.  (Patch by Jeremy Rand.)
