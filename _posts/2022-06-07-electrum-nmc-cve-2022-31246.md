Electrum-NMC v4.0.0b0 and earlier are affected by [CVE-2022-31246](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31246) / [GHSA-4fh4-hx35-r355](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/security/advisories/GHSA-4fh4-hx35-r355) (the vulnerability is inherited from upstream Electrum).  Electrum-NMC v4.0.0b1 and ncdns for Windows v0.3.1 contain the fix.  Tor Browser Nightly was not vulnerable.  We would like to thank [Unciphered](https://www.unciphered.com/) and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) for reporting the vulnerability and coordinating the disclosure with us, and upstream Electrum for implementing the fix.
