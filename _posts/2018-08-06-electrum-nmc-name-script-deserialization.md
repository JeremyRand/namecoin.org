title: "Electrum-NMC: Name Script Deserialization"
author: Jeremy Rand

I previously wrote about [making ElectrumX (the server) handle name scripts]({{ "/2018/07/15/electrumx-name-scripts.html" | relative_url }}).  Now that that's out of the way, the next step is making Electrum-NMC (the client) handle name scripts as well.  I now have Electrum-NMC deserializing name scripts.

Most of the details of this work are fairly mundane implementation details that probably won't interest most readers.  So, instead, how about a screenshot?
