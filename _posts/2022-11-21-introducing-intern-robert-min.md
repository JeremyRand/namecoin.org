Hey everyone, Jeremy here.  We're happy to announce that Namecoin has accepted an intern via [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) (we are participating under the Tor Project umbrella).  Robert Min will be funded to work on a new project that I think both the Namecoin and Tor communities will find exciting.  Huge thanks are due to Tor Project for taking us under their wing for this internship.  I don't want to steal his thunder any more than I already have, so I'm going to turn over the remainder of this post to Robert to tell you about his project -- please join us in welcoming him to the Namecoin community!

This work was funded by Outreachy under the Tor Project umbrella.
