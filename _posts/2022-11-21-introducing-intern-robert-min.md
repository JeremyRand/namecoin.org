Hey everyone, Jeremy here.  We're happy to announce that Namecoin has accepted an intern via [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) (we are participating under the Tor Project umbrella).  Robert Nganga will be funded to work on a new project that I think both the Namecoin and Tor communities will find exciting.  Huge thanks are due to Tor Project for taking us under their wing for this internship.  I don't want to steal his thunder any more than I already have, so I'm going to turn over the remainder of this post to Robert to tell you about his project -- please join us in welcoming him to the Namecoin community!

Greetings, I am pleased to join the Namecoin team as a [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Intern after two months of contributing to Namecoin. I'll be working on developing a tool that can identify and prevent proxy leaks. I'll be using ptrace to intercept network socket system calls in a Tor-using application and block them if they constitute a proxy leak. Given the substantial threats posed by proxy leaks, the technology will improve security and privacy while resolving current problems with the technologies already in use. 
The project will be mentored by Jeremy Rand, who will also provide any support required.

This work was funded by Outreachy under the Tor Project umbrella.
