The Freenode IRC network is actively undergoing a [hostile takeover](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409/) by London Trust Media Holdings.  All Freenode staff have resigned in protest.  **We strongly recommend that all Namecoin community members who are accessing our IRC channels via Freenode abandon ship immediately, and move to our channels on Hackint, OFTC, or Matrix.org.**
