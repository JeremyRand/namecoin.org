We've released ConsensusJ-Namecoin v0.3.1.  Here's what's new:

* Some of the Namecoin-specific code has been merged upstream to ConsensusJ, and has therefore benefited from more peer review.
* Improvements from upstream ConsensusJ.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads]({{ "/download/betas/#consensusj-namecoin" | relative_url }}) page.
