Now that Namecoin Core's [Name Renewal GUI]({{ "/2020/12/05/namecoin-core-name-renew-gui.html" | relative_url }}) is complete (it's been merged and will be in Namecoin Core v22.0), it's time to move on to the `name_update` GUI.  This forward-port was pretty uneventful, so rather than boring you with details, here's a screenshot:

Code review will be needed before a merge can happen, but I expect the review process to be pretty uneventful as well.
