We've released Electrum-NMC v3.2.4b1.  This is a beta release (even more so than the other downloads on the Beta Downloads page); expect a higher risk of bugs than usual.  (As one example of a bug due to it being a beta, it doesn't build for Windows without errors, so this release is for GNU/Linux users only.)  Here's what's new:

* Name support.
* Checkpoint at height 385055.
* Fix macOS build issue.
* Code quality improvements.
* From upstream Electrum: the Safe-T mini hardware wallet from Archos is now supported.
* Other improvements from upstream Electrum.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{site.baseurl}}download/betas/#electrum-nmc).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund and Cyphrs.
