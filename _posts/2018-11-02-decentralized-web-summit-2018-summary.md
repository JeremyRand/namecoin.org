As was [previously announced]({{ "/2018/07/23/decentralized-web-summit-2018.html" | relative_url }}), I (Jeremy Rand) represented Namecoin at [Decentralized Web Summit 2018](https://decentralizedweb.net/) in San Francisco.

This time, the focus of my attendance was less on giving talks and more about talking with other attendees about possible collaborations.  As usual, I won't be publicly disclosing the content of those conversations, because I want people to be able to talk to me at conferences without worrying that off-the-cuff comments will be broadcast to the public.

That said, I did give a lightning talk.  You can view the [official recording page](https://decentralizedweb.net/videos/lightning-talks-new-discoveries-session-1/) (JavaScript required, yuck!), or you can view [the video file itself](https://ia801508.us.archive.org/11/items/dweb-8_1_18_HyperRoom_lightningTalksNewDiscoveries-1/8_1_18_HyperRoom_lightning%20Talks%20New%20Discoveries-1.mp4) (no JavaScript required; my lightning talk is at 24:15 - 32:08).

Thanks to Internet Archive for inviting me, we're looking forward to the next event!
