title: "Namecoin Lightweight SPV Lookup Client 0.2.7 Beta 1 Source Code Available"

Version 0.2.7 Beta 1 of the Namecoin Lightweight SPV Lookup Client has had its source code released.  [Build instructions are here (it's the "bleeding-edge branch").]({{ "/docs/bitcoinj-name-lookups/" | relative_url }})  Binaries will be made available later.  Meanwhile, the former bleeding-edge branch (the branch that introduced leveldbtxcache mode) has graduated to partially-stable.  The former partially-stable branch has been deprecated.

Happily, the 0.2.7 Beta 1 release is using an unmodified upstream libdohj, since Ross Nicoll from Dogecoin has merged all of my changes.  I'm still working to get the relevant ConsensusJ (formerly bitcoinj-addons) code merged upstream.  **As usual, the SPV client is experimental.  Namecoin Core is still substantially more secure against most threat models.**
