We've released Electrum-NMC v3.3.3.1.1.  This release includes an important fix for name transactions (both wallet and lookups), and we recommend that all users upgrade.  Here's what's new since v3.3.3.1:

* Remove mandatory wallet dependency for name_show

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{site.baseurl}}download/betas/#electrum-nmc).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund and Cyphrs.
