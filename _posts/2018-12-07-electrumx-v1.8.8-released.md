[Upstream ElectrumX](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx) has released v1.8.8, which includes [name script support]({{site.baseurl}}2018/10/25/electrumx-name-scripts-merged.html).  (ElectrumX then subsequently released some other minor revisions, which seem to mostly be bug fixes; the latest release is currently v1.8.12.)  If you run a Namecoin ElectrumX server, please consider upgrading to the latest ElectrumX release so that your users will be able to use name scripts.

(And a reminder that we need more ElectrumX instances... please consider running one if you have a server with spare resources!)
