Now that we got [NSS `certutil` reproducibly cross-compiled for Windows]({{ "/2018/05/17/reproducible-builds-certutil-cross-compiling-rbm.html" | relative_url }}), initial testing has begun on `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` for Windows.

Besides the obvious and rather boring fail that `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` was trying to execute `cp`, which of course isn't going to work on Windows (that particular code segment is a relic from quick prototyping that wasn't ever intended to stay in the codebase), two more interesting issues were identified:

1. rbm builds `certutil` with the Visual C++ 2010 runtime, so running `certutil` without that runtime installed produces an obvious error.  However, in order to properly detect the built-in certificates ("CKBI") that Firefox ships with, `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` makes `certutil` load the CKBI module that Firefox distributes (*not* the CKBI module that `certutil` was built with).  This means that, when `certutil` is asked to load Firefox's CKBI module, the Visual C++ runtime used by Firefox's CKBI module also needs to be present.  Which happens to be Visual C++ 2015.  Without that, `certutil` looks like it's working -- but the moment the Firefox CKBI module is loaded into `certutil`, `certutil` exits with a missing DLL error.  However, the situation is worsened by the fact that, as far as I can tell, a missing DLL error in Windows doesn't impact the exit code.  So `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` doesn't actually know thet `certutil` encountered an error; it just thinks it succeeded, and happened to produce no output.  What happens if `certutil` produces no output when dumping the CKBI list?  Well, `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` just figures that you're using a Firefox build *that doesn't have any default trusted CA's!*  This is bad enough when you first run `tlsrestrict_nss_tool`, since it will basically be a no-op.  But even worse, if you *did* have the Visual C++ dependency from Firefox, but then Firefox upgraded it, then the next time you try to run `tlsrestrict_nss_tool`, all of the name constraints that were previously added will get *deleted*, because `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` figures that those CA's have vanished.  How sad.  The fix here is probably to make `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` explicitly error if the CKBI module appears to have 0 certificates in it.  Such a scenario pretty much always indicates that *something* has gone horribly wrong involving the CKBI module, and it's generally best to treat it as an error.
2. `certutil`'s certificate dumping functions require selecting a certificate by its nickname.  What's a nickname?  In practice, for the CKBI module it seems to be the CommonName of the certificate.  The nickname is passed to `certutil` via a command line flag.  What could possibly go wrong here?  Certificate nicknames can be arbitrary text, including Unicode.  What happens when you pass Unicode as a command line argument in Windows?  Nothing good happens, that's for sure.  In my testing, Windows will corrupt all of the non-ASCII characters, which results in `certutil` receiving a corrupted nickname to look up (and it correctly replies that no such nickname exists in the database).  The fix here is to use `certutil`'s "batch command" feature.  `certutil` allows you to put a sequence of commands into a `.txt` file, and you can pass that `.txt` file's path to `certutil` with a command line flag; `certutil` will then run all of those commands.  Since the `.txt` file isn't parsed by Windows's broken command line text decoder, Unicode inside the `.txt` file passes through unharmed.

Now, I haven't actually *fixed* these bugs yet.  But, progress is progress.  Hopefully fixes will be coming very soon.
