We've released Electrum-NMC v3.2.2.2.  Here's what's new:

* Fix exchange rate display.
* Fix a few places where the UI still said "Bitcoin" instead of "Namecoin".
* Building for macOS might work now (no official macOS binaries yet, though).
* Code quality improvements.
* Build script fix from upstream Electrum.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{ "/download/betas/#electrum-nmc" | relative_url }}).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund.
