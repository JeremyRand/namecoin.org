The Tor Project has [released](https://blog.torproject.org/node/1828) Tor 0.4.3.1-alpha.  Among the usual interesting changes, Namecoin users will be interested to note that Tor 0.4.3.1-alpha includes [Namecoin's stream isolation patch for Tor controllers such as StemNS]({{site.baseurl}}2019/12/09/stream-isolation-for-namecoin-name-lookups.html), which paves the way for better Namecoin resolution support for Tor.  Kudos to The Tor Project on getting Tor 0.4.3.1-alpha released!
