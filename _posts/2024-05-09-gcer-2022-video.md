title: Video, Slides, and Paper from Namecoin at GCER 2022

This post is a bit late, but I represented Namecoin at the 2022 Global Conference on Educational Robotics.  Although GCER doesn't produce official recordings of their talks, I was able to obtain an amateur recording of my talk from an audience member.  I've also posted my slides, as well as my paper from the conference proceedings.

It should be noted that, as this is an amateur recording, the audio quality is not spectacular.  It should also be noted that the audience is rather different from the audiences for whom I usually give Namecoin talks; as a result, the focus of the content is also rather different from my usual Namecoin talks.

Huge thanks to the staff and volunteers from KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, who organized GCER.  Also huge thanks to Helene Myers for the recording.
