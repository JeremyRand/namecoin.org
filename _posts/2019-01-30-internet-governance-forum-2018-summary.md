As was [previously announced]({{site.baseurl}}2018/11/09/internet-governance-forum-2018.html), I (Jeremy Rand) represented Namecoin at [Internet Governance Forum 2018](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/) in Paris.

My panel at IGF (moderated by Chiara Petrioli from Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza) went reasonably well, and a quite diverse set of perspectives were represented.  I suspect that a lot of the attendees had never been exposed to the cypherpunk philosophy of "trusted third parties are security holes" (credit to Nick Szabo for that phrasing), and I hope I did a good job of providing that exposure so that maybe we'll have some new allies.  As with ICANN58, I continued my adherence to the Fluffypony way of answering questions: don't hype things, and always be quick to admit disadvantages.  This worked well at ICANN, and I think it worked well at IGF.  (Special thanks to the guy from Verisign who asked a question in the Q&A that will shortly be immortalized in the Namecoin.org FAQ!)

IGF has published a [transcript](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-day-1-salle-vi-ws408-dns-enhancements-and-alternatives-for-the-future-internet)[1], a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyTNAXdd7Qc&pbjreload=10), and a [report](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-ws-408-dns-enhancements-and-alternatives-for-the-future-internet).  The transcript and report should work fine in Tor Browser at High Security settings; the video recording can be viewed via [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) ([Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/youtube-dl)) ([recommendation by Whonix](https://forums.whonix.org/t/vlc-apparmor-profile-wip-streaming-documentation-for-whonix-install-youtube-dl-by-default/2918)) if you don't trust YouTube's JavaScript (and there's no reason why you should trust YouTube's JavaScript!).  I've also posted [my slides]({{site.baseurl}}resources/presentations/IGF_2018/Namecoin_IGF_2018.pdf).

The next day, I was on a panel hosted by Jean-Christophe Finidori.  This one was a bit more in my comfort zone, as the attendees were mostly blockchain enthusiasts, and there were a lot of quite sophisticated questions about the details of Namecoin's design.  Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any recordings of this event.

Of course, I had lots of other meetings while I was in Paris, but as usual, I won't be publicly disclosing the content of those conversations, because I want people to be able to talk to me at conferences without worrying that off-the-cuff comments will be broadcast to the public.  That said, the result of one of those conversations is likely to be posted very soon.

Thanks to Chiara and Jean-Christophe for inviting me; I enjoyed visiting Paris!

[1] Reading the official transcript makes me realize how lucky I am that I'm not hearing-impaired.  Hearing-impaired people are going to have a miserable time trying to understand the transcript.
