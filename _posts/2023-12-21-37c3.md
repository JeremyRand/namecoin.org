After a lengthy pandemic-induced hiatus, C3 is finally back this year, and we're happy to announce that three Namecoin developers will be at [37C3 (the 37th Chaos Communication Congress)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in Hamburg, December 27-30.

Excitingly, one of our developers in attendance (Hugo Landau) will be giving a talk in the main track (not a Cluster track); [the details for that talk are here](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2023/fahrplan/events/11781.html).

We expect to give some additional talks and workshops at the [Critical Decentralization Cluster (CDC)](https://decentral.community/), however, the details of those events are still in flux and will probably not be announced until shortly before the beginning of the Congress; keep an eye on [the CDC schedule](https://frab.riat.at/en/37c3/public/schedule). Recordings and live-streams may happen as well.

In the past, Namecoin has participated in C3 as a Project of the Monero Assembly. We're excited to announce that this year, Namecoin has been upgraded to a full Assembly of our own. Namecoin and Monero remain excellent friends, but everyone agreed that this year, the time was right for us to branch out as an independent Assembly. Also thanks go out to our friends at [The Replicant Assembly](https://replicant.us/), who are once again facilitating Namecoin's participation. We're looking forward to the Congress!
