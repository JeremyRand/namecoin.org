The Tor Project has [released](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85) Tor Browser 8.5.  Among the usual interesting changes, Namecoin users will be interested to note that Tor Browser 8.5 includes [Namecoin's `certutil` Windows/macOS patch]({{ "/2018/10/15/certutil-rbm-merged-tor-project.html" | relative_url }}), which paves the way for better Namecoin TLS support in Firefox on Windows and macOS.  For the #reckless among you who want to experiment, the `certutil` binaries are available [here](http://rqef5a5mebgq46y5.onion/torbrowser/) (or [here](https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/) for those of you who can't access onion services); specifically you want the `mar-tools` downloads.  Kudos to The Tor Project on getting Tor Browser 8.5 released!
