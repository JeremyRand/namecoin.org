title: "NSS certutil Windows rbm Build Scripts Submitted Upstream to The Tor Project"

Previously, I covered [cross-compiling NSS certutil for Windows]({{site.baseurl}}2018/05/17/reproducible-builds-certutil-cross-compiling-rbm.html) via Tor's rbm build scripts.  Since I like to be a good neighbor, I've since reached out to the very nice people at Tor, and have submitted a patch to get this merged upstream.  I've already received a Concept ACK, although they cautioned me that they're quite busy with other Tor Browser things at the moment and it may take a while for them to review my patch.  The Tor people requested that I consider adding macOS support as well; I've done so and that patch is also submitted to Tor for review.

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund.
