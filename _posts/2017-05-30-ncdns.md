title: ncdns for Windows Beta Installer Now Available

tags: [Releases, ncdns Releases]

In order to facilitate the easy resolution of `.bit` domains, an installer for
ncdns for Windows has been under development. This installer automatically
installs and configures Namecoin Core, Unbound and ncdns.

An experimental binary release for this installer is now available. Interested
Namecoin users are encouraged to test the installer and report any issues they
encounter.

* [ncdns-install.exe]({{ "/files/ncdns/ncdns-2017-05-25-notreproduced/ncdns-install-2017-05-25-notreproduced.exe" | relative_url }})
* [ncdns-install.exe.sig]({{ "/files/ncdns/ncdns-2017-05-25-notreproduced/ncdns-install-2017-05-25-notreproduced.exe.sig" | relative_url }})

This release does not yet integrate the TLS integration support for ncdns under
development by Jeremy Rand. This will be incorporated in a future release.

The development of this installer was funded by NLnet.
