As was [previously announced]({{site.baseurl}}2018/10/29/malta-blockchain-summit-2018.html), Namecoin Chief Scientist Daniel Kraft was a panelist at [Malta Blockchain Summit 2018](https://maltablockchainsummit.com/), on the "Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchains" panel.  A [video of the panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7T4cDABvYo) is now available.    The video can be viewed via [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) ([Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/youtube-dl)) ([recommendation by Whonix](https://forums.whonix.org/t/vlc-apparmor-profile-wip-streaming-documentation-for-whonix-install-youtube-dl-by-default/2918)) if you don't trust YouTube's JavaScript (and there's no reason why you should trust YouTube's JavaScript!).
