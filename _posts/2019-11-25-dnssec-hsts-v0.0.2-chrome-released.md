title: DNSSEC-HSTS v0.0.2 for Google Chrome Released

We've released DNSSEC-HSTS v0.0.2 for Google Chrome.  v0.0.2 is identical to v0.0.1 except for Chrome-related compatibility fixes; we are therefore not releasing v0.0.2 binaries for Firefox.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{ "/download/betas/#dnssec-hsts" | relative_url }}).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund.
