Hello! My name is Robert, an Outreachy Intern. I spend most of my days gaming, coding and learning. Iâ€™ve been very interested in open-source projects, and two months after contributing to Namecoin, I started my internship. For the two months, the experience has been very enjoyable and interesting.

## My Core Values

1. Integrity: I believe in being honest and transparent in all my actions and decisions.
2. Innovation: I value creativity and constantly strive to find new and better ways of doing things.
3. Collaboration: I believe in working together with others to achieve common goals and create successful outcomes.

## What motivated me to apply to Outreachy

Several factors influenced my decision to apply to Outreachy. To begin, I am really interested in open source and want to obtain practical experience in this subject. Outreachy is a fantastic chance for people like me to contribute to open source projects while learning from experienced mentors.

Second, I am enthusiastic in learning new things and honing my talents. Outreachy provides a structured internship program in which I may work on difficult projects while developing my technical and professional abilities.

Finally, I feel Outreachy will give me with beneficial networking chances. I am looking forward to meeting other Outreachy participants and mentors and developing contacts that will benefit my career.

This work was funded by Outreachy under the Tor Project umbrella.
