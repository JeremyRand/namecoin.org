We've released ncdns v0.2.2.  This release contains multiple bugfixes, in particular a patch to `generate_nmc_cert` that works around a CryptoAPI connectivity bug.  We strongly recommend that all users upgrade.  **All domain owners who have TLS enabled will need to re-generate their TLS certificates and TLS records after upgrading.**

Full changelog of what's new since v0.2:

* ncdns
    - Remove tlsrestrict_chromium_tool binary.  (certinject should be used instead now.)
    - Code quality improvements.
* generate_nmc_cert
    - Disable AIA over HTTPS.  (No major TLS clients support it, and it was tickling a CryptoAPI connectivity bug.)
    - Rebase against Go 1.17.
    - Code quality improvements.
* ncp11
    - Temporarily suspend providing macOS binaries of ncp11.  (macOS support for ncp11 will return after the ongoing p11mod refactor has completed.)
* Windows installer
    - Support chain-installing and configuring Electrum-NMC.
    - Redesign Components dialogs.
    - Fix installation error on certain non-English locales, e.g. Swedish.  (Thanks to Jonas Ostman.)
    - Warn users of Windows 7 and earlier.  (ncdns hasn't supported these EOL Windows versions for a while; users who are okay with security degradation will be able to bypass the warning and install anyway.)
    - Relicense under GPLv3+.
    - Remove non-freedom build dependency.
    - Code quality improvements.
* Build system:
    - Downgrade to BIND 9.16 branch for Windows.  (Upstream BIND has dropped Windows support in 9.17 branch.)
    - Relicense ncdns-repro under tor-browser-build license.  (Thanks to Nicolas Vigier and Georg Koppen.)
    - Code quality improvements.
    - Bump dependencies:
        * tor-browser-build
        * gobtcd
        * godns
        * goisatty
        * gopretty
        * gotoml
