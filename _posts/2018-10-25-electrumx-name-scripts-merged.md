title: "ElectrumX: Name Script Support Merged by Upstream"

A few months ago I wrote about [name script support in ElectrumX]({{site.baseurl}}2018/07/15/electrumx-name-scripts.html).  Neil from ElectrumX has now merged that code into ElectrumX master branch.  I've also notified the operator of the public ElectrumX Namecoin instance, so hopefully soon it will be possible to use Electrum-NMC's name script support with the default public ElectrumX instance.  Kudos to Neil for accepting the pull request!

(This is probably a good time to remind readers that we need more ElectrumX instances... please consider running one if you have a server with spare resources!)
