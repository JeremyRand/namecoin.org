The Namecoin website is now available via Namecoin at [https://namecoin.bit/](https://namecoin.bit/).  The TLS certificate should work in most Namecoin-supported [TLS clients]({{ "/docs/tls-client" | relative_url }}), but unfortunately doesn't yet work with Tor Browser.  This will be fixed in the future.
