The [Beta Downloads page]({{ "/download/betas/" | relative_url }}) now includes Nightly builds of ncdns (both the plain binaries and the Windows installer) and certinject.  For the #reckless among you who want to help us test new features or identify bugs before a release, the Nightly builds are a great way to do so.
