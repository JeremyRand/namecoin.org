We've released ncdns v0.0.4.  This release incorporates a bugfix in the madns dependency, which fixes a DNSSEC signing bug.  The ncdns Windows installer in this release also updated the Dnssec-Trigger dependency.

As usual, you can download it at the [Beta Downloads page]({{site.baseurl}}download/betas/).

This work was funded by NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund.
